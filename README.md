Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This application was primarily designed as a way for users to plan and track their upcoming events into one, consolidated, location. It receives input from the user and stores their events in a database from which a list of events is displayed on the home screen of the application with the most current event at the top of the screen, and the furthest away, from the current date, at the bottom of the screen. A user is able to edit and or delete an event by simply clicking on it within the list. A user will receive a notification at or around the upcoming date of an event as a reminder. The user also is required to register an account with a unique username and password, which are also stored in a separate SQLite database, in order to access the application.
  
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were a variety of screens implemented to focus the UI towards provoking a positive, and easy to use, experience for the user. Some of the screens included are: a login and registration screen, an event calendar screen, a view event screen, an edit event screen, a delete event screen, and a notifications settings screen. The layout of each screen is nearly identical which provides a homogenous flow throughout the application and provides a straightforward layout for the user to follow from one screen to another. I also made sure to keep relatively similar color schemes for each screen so as to also promote this consistency in design. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I relied heavily on referencing the various resources I was provided with throughout this course like the Android developers guide and the various other resources offered on the Android developer website. I also employed frequent testing within the built in emulator in Android studio to help identify issues as they happened and fix them quickly. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I frequently used the bult in emulator in Android studio to test my application and made sure to identify any problem that arose as quickly as possible so that I could spare myself a much worse headache later on trying to deal with multiple bugs all at once. This process was important as,  I imagine, it helped speed up my development time quite drastically and made the process overall a lot more manageable. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The whole application development process was a lot of innovation for me as it was my first experience developing a full-fledged application from the ground up. I would say the time that took the most effort on my part was incorporating the database functialites into the application as I had to brush up a bit on my Java knowledge.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I would say the application's database features and how they are incorporated into the final functionality are the most successful aspects of this program. They are an integral part of facilitating the login and registration as well as event tracking and CRUD functions within the application.
